# MeshLLM 

## Project Purpose
This project is a modular, browser-based demo for LLM-powered 3D mesh code generation and editing. It demonstrates how point clouds can be converted to editable Blender Python code, visualized, and semantically analyzedâ€”all in the browser. The codebase is structured for rapid prototyping, extension, and collaborative development.

---

## Architecture & Key Modules
- **index.html**: Main entry point. Defines all UI sections, loads Bulma, FontAwesome, and custom JS/CSS. Orchestrates the mesh/code/analysis workflow.
- **static/js/**: All interactive logic. Key files:
  - `editing.js`: Shape editing logic (code-mesh sync, code editor, mesh viewer controls)
  - `understanding.js`: Shape understanding/analysis logic (Q&A, code highlighting)
  - `three-viewer.js`: 3D mesh rendering and interaction (Three.js abstraction)
  - `code.js`: Code display, syntax highlighting, and code block mapping
- **static/css/**: Modular styles for each section (editing, understanding, code display)
- **assets/models/**: 3D models in `.glb`/`.gltf` format (default: `sofa.glb`)

---

## Shape Editing Section 

### Features
- Two-panel layout: 3D mesh viewer and editable code
- Hover/click code lines to highlight/focus mesh parts
- Live code editing with syntax highlighting
- Controls: Execute, Reset, Reset View, Wireframe toggle
- Responsive design

### How to Use/Extend
- **Edit code parameters** in the code editor (e.g., change `'cube'` to `'cylinder'`, adjust scale/location)
- **Click Execute** to apply changes; Reset to restore defaults
- **Hover/click** code lines to highlight/focus mesh parts
- **Add your own 3D model**:
  1. Export as `.glb`/`.gltf`, place in `assets/models/` (e.g., `sofa.glb`)
  2. Update the model source in `index.html`:
     ```html
     <model-viewer id="meshViewer" src="assets/models/your-model.glb" ...>
     ```
  3. Map code to mesh parts in `static/js/code.js` (see below)

#### Example: Mapping Code to Mesh Parts
In `static/js/code.js`, update the mesh-code mapping:
```js
identifyMeshParts() {
    this.meshParts = [
        { name: 'seat', lineIndex: 1 },
        { name: 'backrest', lineIndex: 4 },
        { name: 'leg_1', lineIndex: 7 },
        // ...
    ];
}
```

#### Example: Changing the Example Code
- In `editing.js` or `understanding.js`, update the `defaultCode` or `sofaCode` string to your new code block.
- For more advanced changes, update the code parsing and mesh generation logic in `editing.js`.

---

## Shape Understanding (Q&A) Section
- Q&A logic is in `static/js/understanding.js`.
- To change or add questions/answers:
  1. Update the HTML Q&A block in `index.html` (search for `questionSet`)
  2. Update the answer logic in `understanding.js` (see `handleQuestion` and answer mapping)

#### Example: Adding a New Q&A
In `index.html`:
```html
<div class="qa-item" data-question="new_feature">
  <div class="question">
    <span class="question-icon">Q:</span>
    <span class="question-text">How is the new feature constructed?</span>
    <button class="ask-button" data-target="new_feature">Ask</button>
  </div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer-new_feature" style="display: none;">
    <div class="answer-content">
      <span class="answer-icon">ðŸ¤–</span>
      <span class="answer-text">[Your answer here]</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
In `understanding.js`, add logic to return the new answer for `new_feature`.

---

## Advanced Customization
- For real mesh-code synchronization, extend the Three.js logic in `three-viewer.js` and mesh-code mapping in `editing.js`.
- To support new mesh types or code primitives, update the code parsing and mesh generation logic.
- For UI/UX changes, edit the relevant section in `index.html` and corresponding CSS/JS modules.

---

## Collaboration Notes
- All logic is modular and sectioned for easy extension.
- When adding new features, keep code and mesh mapping explicit for maintainability.
- For new 3D cases, ensure code is semantically segmented for best LLM analysis results.
- See inline comments in JS files for extension points.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Model not loading**: Check path/format in `assets/models/`, update `index.html` src.
- **Code highlighting not working**: Ensure JS is enabled, check for DOM/initialization errors.
- **Interactive features not responding**: Verify all scripts and event listeners are loaded, check browser console.

## Maintenance
- This README now integrates all content from the former `SHAPE_EDITING_README.md`, which has been deleted for clarity and single-source documentation.
